# **Spam Email Classifier**
## 1. Introduction
Objective: Explain the goal of the spam email classifier project, which is to identify and filter out spam emails from legitimate ones.
Importance: Discuss the significance of spam email classification in improving email communication efficiency and security.






## 2. Data Collection
Dataset: Describe the dataset used, such as the Enron Spam dataset or any other publicly available email dataset.
Features: Outline the features of the dataset, including email content, metadata, and labels (spam or not spam).


## 3. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning: Detail the steps taken to clean the data, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing text.
Text Processing: Explain text processing techniques used, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and removal of stop words.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations: Present visualizations to understand the distribution of spam and non-spam emails, common words in spam emails, and any other relevant insights.
Statistics: Provide statistical analysis of the dataset, such as the proportion of spam vs. non-spam emails.
## 5. Feature Extraction
Bag of Words (BoW): Describe the use of the Bag of Words model to convert text data into numerical features.
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Explain how TF-IDF is used to weigh the importance of words in the dataset.
Other Techniques: Mention any additional feature extraction methods, such as word embeddings or n-grams.

## 6. Model Selection
Algorithms: Discuss various classification algorithms considered, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.
Evaluation: Describe the criteria for selecting the final model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 7. Model Training
Training Process: Detail the process of training the chosen model on the training dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Explain any hyperparameter tuning performed to improve model performance.


## 8. Model Evaluation
Metrics: Provide metrics used to evaluate the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
Confusion Matrix: Show the confusion matrix to illustrate the model’s performance in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.


## 9.  Results
Performance: Present the performance results of the model, including the classification report and any notable findings.
Examples: Provide examples of correctly and incorrectly classified emails to give a practical view of the model’s effectiveness.


## 10. Conclusion
Summary: Summarize the key findings of the project, including the effectiveness of the spam email classifier and any challenges encountered.
Future Work: Suggest potential improvements, such as incorporating more advanced text processing techniques, exploring other models, or expanding the dataset.
